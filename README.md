## IMPORTANT!
- I do not support any type of malicious activity with my code, nor take any responsability for any damage caused by it. Use at your own risk. 
- For learning purposes

## Note
- ⭐️ Give me a Star!! Kerpy is constantly updating, support us!
- The analysis was done with my grabber (+8 features), this without having obfuscated the source code (either with pyarmor etc), I recommend using Kerpy + obfuscate your code for best results.
- List of HWID/MAC/IP/GPU are from 6nz (https://github.com/6nz/virustotal-vm-blacklist)
